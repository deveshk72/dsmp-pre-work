### Project Overview

 Spygames is project in which we read different files to extract messages from them to perform operations like reading files,combining,filtering and writing etc.


### Learnings from the project

 After completion of this project I have learnt about the flow of programming in python.The how,what and when to use different functions,loops,file operations and  basic approach to implement object oriented in python.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Lets take an example of Message Substitution in which we need to extract message from files and put it in different variables. For this we used the functions provided in pyhton like open,read and write functions for file and extracted it and stored it variable by providing the path of the file and whether the file should be used for reading or writing purposes.And then used a function to perform these steps to split it into parts so that can be implemented easily and used concurrently.


### Challenges faced

 While writing the Message Comparison program I used to function to split the messages and stored it into different lists to compare them and created a third list which had a condition.After executiing the code it always returned the output which was not intended.So after a few tries and after some revisions I found the problem which was not using the 'return' to pass the values to the function which would display the final result.


### Additional pointers

 This is a very basic project in Python which was made after understanding the program flow in python and to increase the understanding and implementation of various loops,functions etc.
